## DSA Practice in Java

This project is a **hands‑on DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms) practice repo in Java**.

- Each **folder** contains a **topic** (arrays, linked lists, trees, etc.).
- Inside each topic folder:
  - A `README.md` lists **questions / problems**.
  - One or more **Java starter files** (with `TODO` comments) where you implement the solutions.

You can open this folder in **VS Code, IntelliJ, or Cursor**, and solve problems one by one.

### How to compile and run (simple `javac` way)

From the project root:

```bash
javac arrays/TwoSum.java
java arrays.TwoSum
```

or, if the file has no package:

```bash
javac arrays/TwoSum.java
java TwoSum
```

Most starter files here **do not use packages** to keep things simple, so you can usually do:

```bash
javac arrays/TwoSum.java
java TwoSum
```

### Suggested learning order

1. `arrays`
2. `strings`
3. `searching`
4. `sorting`
5. `linkedlist`
6. `stack_queue`
7. `recursion`
8. `trees`
9. `graphs`
10. `dynamic_programming`

Try to:

- First, **read the `README.md`** inside a topic folder.
- Then, **open the Java file** for a problem and complete the `TODO` sections.
- Finally, **compile and run** with `javac` and `java` to test your solution.
