Topic,Question,Beginner Approach,Optimized / Pattern-Based Approach
Basic Sorting,Bubble Sort,Compare adjacent elements & swap,Recognize it’s O(n²) & avoid for large input
Basic Sorting,Selection Sort,Find minimum & put at right place,Use selection when swaps must be minimized
Basic Sorting,Insertion Sort,Shift elements and insert in sorted position,Use insertion for nearly sorted arrays
Intermediate Sorting,Sorting Stability Concept,Test sorting with duplicate elements,Learn which algorithms preserve stability
Intermediate Sorting,Sorting in Descending / Custom Order,Modify comparator / reverse loops,Comparator functions / lambda sorting
Divide & Conquer Sorting,Merge Sort,Split → sort → merge,O(n log n) efficient stable sort
Divide & Conquer Sorting,Quick Sort,Partition around pivot,Randomized pivot → average O(n log n)
Optimized Patterns,Counting Sort,Count occurrences & rebuild array,O(n) for small integer ranges
Optimized Patterns,Bucket / Radix Sort,Distribute into buckets; sort individually,Great for floating values / large numbers
Advanced Sorting,Sort Colors / Dutch National Flag,Brute force multiple passes,Three-pointer partitioning (O(n))
