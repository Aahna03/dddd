Topic,Question,Beginner Approach,Optimized / Pattern-Based Approach
Queue Basics,Implement Queue using Array,Use array & shift elements on dequeue (O(n)),Use circular index for O(1) ops
Queue Basics,Implement Queue using Linked List,Use LL nodes for enqueue/dequeue,Linked list queue with O(1) ops
Queue Basics,Implement Circular Queue,Track front & rear manually,Modulo arithmetic for efficient wrap-around
Intermediate Queues,Queue using Two Stacks,Push all elements from one stack to another repeatedly,Amortized O(1) queue using two stacks
Intermediate Queues,Stack using Two Queues,Use expensive enqueue/dequeue without optimization,Use push-pop balancing to get O(1) amortized
Intermediate Queues,Generate Binary Numbers using Queue,Generate binary numbers using brute force,Use queue to simulate binary expansion
Advanced Queue Patterns,Sliding Window Maximum (Deque),Use nested loops to find max,Deque (Monotonic Queue) → O(n)
Advanced Queue Patterns,Rotten Oranges (BFS),Simulate spreading without BFS,Multi-source BFS
Advanced Queue Patterns,First Non-Repeating Character in Stream,Use hashmap & re-check entire stream each time,Queue + frequency + stream processing
Advanced Queue Patterns,LRU Cache Concept,Store all states & search linearly,Use LinkedHashMap / deque for O(1) operations
