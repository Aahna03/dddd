Topic,Question,Beginner Approach,Optimized / Pattern-Based Approach
Linked List Basics,Create & Traverse a Linked List,Simple node creation & pointer traversal,Pointer iteration (O(n))
Linked List Basics,Insert at Head / Tail,Manually adjust pointers for head/tail,Constant-time insert using pointer manipulations
Linked List Basics,Delete a Node,Traverse & find previous to delete,Two-pointer approach for deletions
Linked List Operations,Reverse a Linked List,Use extra array to store values then rebuild,"In-place reversal using 3 pointers (prev, curr, next)"
Linked List Operations,Find Middle of Linked List,Count length then move mid positions,Fast & slow pointer (Tortoise-Hare)
Intermediate Linked Lists,Detect Cycle (Floyd’s Algorithm),Use HashSet to track visited nodes,Floyd’s cycle detection (O(1) space)
Intermediate Linked Lists,Remove Cycle,Break loop by scanning again,Finding cycle start using Floyd’s algorithm
Advanced Linked Lists,Merge Two Sorted Lists,Merge arrays then rebuild list,Two-pointer merge technique
Advanced Linked Lists,Intersection of Two Linked Lists,Compare lists using nested loops,Length difference + pointer walk
Advanced Linked Lists,Duplicate Removal in Sorted LL,Loop and remove duplicates manually,One-pass duplicate removal (O(n))
