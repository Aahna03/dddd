Topic,Question,Beginner Approach,Optimized / Pattern-Based Approach
Searching Basics,Linear Search,Check each element one by one,Direct O(n) scan
Searching Basics,Why Searching Needs Sorted Arrays,Try binary search & see failure on unsorted,Sort array or use hashing when allowed
Binary Search Core,Basic Binary Search (Find element),"Use low, high, mid and compare",Binary Search (O(log n))
Binary Search Core,Order-Agnostic Binary Search,Try both ascending and descending by checking order,Detect sort order ? apply binary search
Binary Search Variants,First and Last Occurrence,Linear scan to find all positions,Lower bound / Upper bound using binary search
Binary Search Variants,Find Number of Occurrences,Loop and count repeated elements,Binary search boundaries
Binary Search Variants,Peak Element (Mountain Array),Scan to find peak via brute force,Binary search for peak (unimodal property)
Binary Search on Answer,Minimum Capacity / Threshold Problems,Try all capacities to check feasibility,Binary Search on Answer + feasibility function
Binary Search on Answer,Koko Eating Bananas / Painters Partition,Brute force simulate all speeds/partitions,Binary Search on Answer + monotonic check
Advanced Searching,Search in Rotated Sorted Array,Linear search or naive split,Binary Search with pivot detection
